# dotfiles

This is my no fuss terminal setup. No plugin manager; all self-managed through git.

## Getting started

- Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if macOS
- Install [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) if Arch Linux
- Install [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) via package manager
- Run `sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply jef`
  - You can continue to get updates with the same command

Have fun! :rocket:

### Recommended tools

- Install [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) for a colorful `ls`
- Install [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for better `cat`
- Install [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for better `vim`
- Install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for fuzzy finding
- Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for better `grep`
- Install [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for better `find`
- Install [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) for a modern terminal emulator

With these tools installed, you'll get preconfigured aliasing.

You can also install all recommended tools with the script `recommended.sh`.

```shell
curl -fsLS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jef/dotfiles/main/recommended.sh | sh
```

## Notes

### SSH

Setting up proper permissions for SSH keys.

```shell
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/known_hosts $public_key
chmod 600 $private_key
```

### GPG

This only really works if you don't mind losing any other keys (than your own).

```shell
# Export public and secret key and ownertrust

gpg -a --export your.email@domain.tld > somename-public-gpg.key
gpg -a --export-secret-keys your.email@domain.tld > somename-secret-gpg.key
gpg --export-ownertrust > somename-ownertrust-gpg.txt

# Import secret key (which contains the public key) and ownertrust

gpg --import somename-secret-gpg.key
gpg --import-ownertrust somename-ownertrust-gpg.txt
```

## AUR

### Updating packages

1. Clone repo: `git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/$repo.git`
1. Update `PKGBUILD`
   1. Edit the file `PKGBUILD` and make necessary changes, i.e. bumping the version number.
1. Update checksums in the PKGBUILD file.
   1. Use the tool `updpkgsums` for this. It can be installed by running `sudo pacman -Sy pacman-contrib`. It does the build, and writes the checksum into `PKGBUILD`.
1. Update `.SRCINFO` file.
   1. It is generated from `PKGBUILD`, and required for the AUR. Run `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`
1. Verify before pushing.
   1. Run `makepkg -C -f --noconfirm`. If it is successful, your package is OK.
1. Push the changes.
